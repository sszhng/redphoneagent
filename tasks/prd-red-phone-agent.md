# Product Requirements Document: Red Phone Agent

## Introduction/Overview

The Red Phone Agent is an AI-powered conversational assistant designed to help sales representatives and account executives resolve issues and navigate case management processes more efficiently. Currently, sales reps lack visibility into policies, rules, and prior cases, making it difficult to self-serve and accurately route cases to the correct teams. This leads to misrouted or incomplete cases that require multiple back-and-forth interactions, delaying resolution and reducing productivity.

The Red Phone Agent will serve as a centralized, intelligent interface that leverages organizational knowledge to help reps resolve issues independently whenever possible, and when escalation is necessary, ensures cases are created with proper routing and complete information from the start.

## Goals

1. **Reduce case creation volume** through improved self-service capabilities
2. **Decrease case resolution time** by providing complete information upfront
3. **Eliminate misrouted cases** through intelligent routing recommendations
4. **Improve sales rep satisfaction** with faster access to policy information and guidance
5. **Reduce approver workload** by providing pre-analyzed cases with recommendations

## User Stories

**As a Sales Rep, I want to:**
- Quickly ask questions about policies and get instant answers so I don't have to search through multiple documents
- Understand whether my customer's request requires a case or can be resolved immediately
- Get guidance on deal structures, pricing policies, and approval requirements
- Create properly formatted cases with all required information when escalation is needed
- Receive recommendations on whether requests meet policy criteria before submitting

**As a Case Approver, I want to:**
- Receive cases that are properly routed to my team with complete context
- See AI-generated recommendations about policy compliance before making decisions
- Have access to relevant historical case data and precedents
- Spend less time asking for additional information from sales reps

## Functional Requirements

1. **Conversational Interface**
   - The system must provide a chat-based interface where sales reps can ask questions in natural language
   - The system must maintain conversation context throughout a session
   - The system must provide clear, actionable responses within 3 seconds

2. **Knowledge Base Integration**
   - The system must access and search Rules of Engagement documents
   - The system must query historical case data to provide relevant precedents
   - The system must reference Case Creation guidelines for proper formatting
   - The system must provide citations/sources for its recommendations

3. **Self-Service Resolution**
   - The system must identify when issues can be resolved without creating a case
   - The system must provide step-by-step guidance for self-service actions
   - The system must explain policy rationale to help reps understand decisions

4. **Intelligent Case Creation**
   - The system must determine when case escalation is necessary
   - The system must pre-populate case forms with relevant information gathered during conversation
   - The system must suggest appropriate routing based on case type and complexity
   - The system must provide policy compliance recommendations before case submission

5. **Policy Lookup and Guidance**
   - The system must answer questions about minimum spend requirements, discount policies, and approval thresholds
   - The system must distinguish between different deal types (New Business, Renewal, Add-on)
   - The system must provide guidance on pilot extensions, pricing exceptions, and special terms

6. **Historical Context**
   - The system must search for similar past cases and their resolutions
   - The system must identify patterns in successful case submissions
   - The system must highlight key information that was required for similar case resolutions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Integration with existing CRM or ServiceNow systems** (future iteration)
- **Real-time case status tracking** (focus is on creation, not monitoring)
- **Multi-language support** (English only for initial version)
- **Mobile application** (web-based only)
- **Advanced analytics dashboard** (basic metrics only)
- **User authentication/permissions** (assume all users have equal access)
- **Case approval workflow automation** (recommendations only, not decisions)

## Design Considerations

- **Chat Interface**: Clean, modern chat window similar to ChatGPT or Slack messaging
- **Response Types**: Support for both text responses and structured data (tables, lists, forms)
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear distinction between self-service solutions and case creation recommendations
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple responses, offer "More Details" options
- **Copy-Paste Friendly**: Responses should be easy to copy for use in other systems
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Technical Considerations

- **Standalone Web Application**: React-based single-page application
- **AI/LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT or similar language model for natural language processing
- **Knowledge Base**: Vector database for document search and retrieval (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate)
- **Dummy Data Sources**: 
  - Sample Rules of Engagement policies (discount thresholds, minimum spends, approval requirements)
  - Mock historical case database (50-100 sample cases with outcomes)
  - Template Case Creation guidelines (required fields, routing logic)
- **Response Time**: Target 2-3 second response times for typical queries
- **Scalability**: Design for 100+ concurrent users

## Success Metrics

1. **Case Volume Reduction**: 40% decrease in total cases created
2. **Resolution Time**: 50% reduction in average case resolution time
3. **Case Quality**: 90% reduction in cases requiring additional information requests
4. **Self-Service Success**: 60% of chat sessions result in self-service resolution
5. **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ rating on 5-point satisfaction scale
6. **Response Accuracy**: 95% of AI recommendations align with policy
7. **Adoption Rate**: 80% of sales reps use the tool at least once per week

## Open Questions

1. **Data Privacy**: What level of customer information can be included in chat logs?
2. **Audit Trail**: Do we need to maintain records of all AI recommendations for compliance?
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: What happens when the AI cannot provide a confident answer?
4. **Update Process**: How will we handle updates to policies and rules in the knowledge base?
5. **Training Data**: What historical cases should be included vs. excluded for privacy/sensitivity?
6. **Error Handling**: How should the system handle contradictory or outdated policy information?
7. **User Feedback**: How will we collect and incorporate user feedback to improve AI responses?

## Example Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Self-Service Resolution**
- Rep: "Customer wants to add 3 seats to their existing deal, but worried about minimum spend"
- Agent: "For Add-on deals, there's no minimum spend requirement unlike New Business (5 seats minimum). You can proceed without approval."

**Use Case 2: Case Creation with Guidance**
- Rep: "Customer needs 9-month pilot extension with 20% discount"
- Agent: "This requires case creation as it exceeds standard 6-month pilot policy and 15% discount threshold. I'll help you create a case with proper justification..."

**Use Case 3: Policy Clarification**
- Rep: "What's the approval threshold for renewal discounts?"
- Agent: "Renewal discounts: 0-10% (auto-approved), 11-20% (manager approval), 21%+ (director approval). What discount percentage are you considering?"
